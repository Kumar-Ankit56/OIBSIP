    <p id="caption"> Atal Bihari Vajpayee 25 December 1924 - 16 August 2018 was an Indian politician and diplomat who
        served three terms as the prime minister of India, first for a term of 13 days in 1996, then for a period of 13
        months from 1998 to 1999, followed by a full term from 1999 to 2004. Vajpayee was one of the co-founders and a
        senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He was a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu
        nationalist volunteer organisation. He was the first Indian prime minister not of the Indian National Congress
        to serve a full term in office. He was also a renowned poet and a writer. <br><br>

        He was a member of the Indian Parliament for over five decades, having been elected ten times to the Lok Sabha,
        the lower house, and twice to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house. He served as the Member of Parliament for
        Lucknow, retiring from active politics in 2009 due to health concerns. He was among the founding members of the
        Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), of which he was president from 1968 to 1972. The BJS merged with several other
        parties to form the Janata Party, which won the 1977 general election. In March 1977, Vajpayee became the
        Minister of External Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister Morarji Desai. He resigned in 1979, and the Janata
        alliance collapsed soon after. Former members of the BJS formed the BJP in 1980, with Vajpayee its first
        president.
        <br><br>
        During his tenure as prime minister, India carried out the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. Vajpayee sought to
        improve diplomatic relations with Pakistan, travelling to Lahore by bus to meet with Prime Minister Nawaz
        Sharif. After the 1999 Kargil War with Pakistan, he sought to restore relations through engagement with
        President Pervez Musharraf, inviting him to India for a summit at Agra.
        <br><br>
        The administration of Narendra Modi declared in 2014 that Vajpayee's birthday, 25 December, would be marked as
        Good Governance Day. In 2015, he was conferred India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, by the
        president of India, Pranab Mukherjee. He died on 16 August 2018 of age-related illness.

            Major Events In life
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> <b>1924 :</b> Vajpayee was born into a Hindu Brahmin family on 25 December 1924 in Gwalior, Madhya
                Pradesh</li> <br>

            <li> <b> 1939 : </b> He also joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1939 as a swayamsevak</li> <br>

            <li> <b>1944 : </b> His activism started in Gwalior with Arya Kumar Sabha, the youth wing of the Arya Samaj
                movement, of which he became the general secretary in 1944.</li> <br>

            <li> <b>Early political career (1947-1975) </b> In 1951, Vajpayee was seconded by the RSS, along with
                Deendayal Upadhyaya, to work for the newly formed Bharatiya Jana Sangh, a Hindu right-wing political
                party associated with the RSS.
                <br>n the 1957 Indian general election, Vajpayee contested elections to the Lok Sabha, the lower house
                of the Indian Parliament. He lost to Raja Mahendra Pratap in Mathura, but was elected from Balrampur. In
                the Lok Sabha his oratorial skills so impressed Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that he predicted that
                Vajpayee would someday become the prime minister of India.
            </li> <br>

            <li> <b>Janata and the BJP (1975-1995)</b> Vajpayee was arrested along with several other opposition leaders
                during the Internal Emergency imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975. <br>In 1977 general
                election janta party won the election and in this Vajpayee served as the minister of external affairs,
                or foreign minister, in Desai's cabinet. As foreign minister, Vajpayee became the first person in 1977
                to deliver a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in Hindi. <br>In 1979, Desai and Vajpayee
                resigned, triggering the collapse of the Janata Party. The erstwhile members of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh
                came together to form the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1980, with Vajpayee as its first President.
            </li> <br>

            <li> <b>Terms as prime minister (1996-2004)</b>May 1996 Indian president Shankar Dayal Sharma invited
                Vajpayee to form the government.Vajpayee was sworn in as the 10th prime minister of India, but the BJP
                failed to muster a majority among members of the Lok Sabha. Vajpayee resigned after 16 days, when it
                became clear that he did not have enough support to form a government. <br> In May 1998, India conducted
                five underground nuclear tests in the Pokhran desert in Rajasthan, 24 years after its first nuclear test
                (Smiling Buddha) in 1974. <br> n late 1998 and early 1999, Vajpayee began a push for a full-scale
                diplomatic peace process with Pakistan. With the historic inauguration of the Delhi-Lahore bus service
                in February 1999, Vajpayee initiated a new peace process aimed towards permanently resolving the Kashmir
                dispute and other conflicts with Pakistan. <br> In May 1999 some Kashmiri shepherds discovered the
                presence of militants and non-uniformed Pakistani soldiers in the Kashmir Valley, where they had taken
                control of border hilltops and unmanned border posts. The incursion was centred around the town of
                Kargil, but also included the Batalik and Akhnoor sectors and artillery exchanges at the Siachen
                Glacier.
                The Indian army responded with Operation Vijay, which launched on 26 May 1999. <br> The 1999 general
                elections were held in the aftermath of the Kargil operations. The BJP-led NDA won 303 seats out of the
                543 seats in the Lok Sabha, securing a comfortable and stable majority. On 13 October 1999, Vajpayee
                took oath as the prime minister of India for the third time. </li> <br>

            <li> <b>2001 :</b> On 13 December 2001, a group of masked, armed men with fake IDs stormed Parliament House in Delhi.[81] The terrorists managed to kill several security guards, but the building was sealed off swiftly and security forces cornered and killed the men who were later proven to be Pakistan nationals.[</li> <br>

            <li> <b>2002 - 2004 :</b> In late 2002 and 2003 the government pushed through economic reforms.

Increasing foreign investment,[107] modernisation of public and industrial infrastructure, the creation of jobs, a rising high-tech and IT industry and urban modernisation and expansion improved the nation's international image.
